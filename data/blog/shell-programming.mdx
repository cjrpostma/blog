Notes

# User and Account Creation

- Shell scripts can end in .sh but it is not required.

`#!/bin/bash`

`\#` = Sharp
`!` = Bang
`#!` = Shebang

/bin/bash = path to interpreter

- When I execute the script, /bin/bash gets executed and the filename is passed as an argument.
- Bash then executes everything in the file
- If I don't specify a path, then the script will be executed by the current shell, which may not be what I want
- No idea who will execute the script so cannot predict their terminal, so always use a path to an interpreter

File permissions
r READ
w WRITE
X EXECUTE

-123-123-123
-rwx-rwx-rwx

Group 1 represents the permissions of the owner of the file
Group 2 represents the permissions of the group of the file
Group 3 represents the permissions everyone else on the system has

-rw-r--r-- 1 user1 user1 1234 Jan 1 1970 file.txt
owner group

chmod 755 my-script.sh

Typically

- rwx for self
- rx for others

These are the "bits" that represent the permissions
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
Add those together
7 for owner
5 for group
5 for everyone else

Hence chmod **755** my-script.sh

"chuh-mod"

I can execute the file just by typing ./my-script.sh when in the current directory

- echo is a shell built-in command
- can use type command, which is also a built-in to see if a command is a shell built-in
- `type echo`
- `type -a echo` to see all instances

Using built-ins is a good idea, it is portable, better available by just using built-in rather than full path

help echo | less

`man echo`

- Variable can be thought of as name/value pairs
- There is no typing or keyword for variables, just assign a value
- There is no space in the assignment
- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, cannot start with a digit

# Special variables, command substitution, if statements, conditionals

`man bash`

`/` allows me search, uses vim
`n` allows next, shift n previous

`type -a id`

The man docs have the following format

`id [OPTIONS]... [USER]`
This means that id can accept multiple arguments for OPTIONS and one argument for USER

When there are multiple args, I can combine them together

`id -n -u` becomes `id -nu`

type -a whoami
whoami is /usr/bin/whoami

The above path shows that whoami is a program, so I will use the man page to learn more, `man whoami`

type -a echo
echo is a shell builtin
echo is /bin/echo

The above shows that echo is a shell built-in, so I will use `help echo`

`;` command separator, can use new line instead

`if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0]]; then echo ... etc.`

`-z STRING` true if string is empty
`-n STRING` true if string is NOT empty

`-lt`
`-gt`

`sudo` super user do

`man test | less`

I should run `man <command>` to learn about all the flags they accept

The UID of the root user is always 0.

# Status, return codes, etc

`exit 1` provides a way to exit the script

If you omit the exit status, then it is set to the last command executed

`-ne` I can view the docs at `help test`

`?` hold the exit status of the most recently executed command

`=` can either be an assignment operator or a comparison operator depending on the context

`==` if using this, string to the right of the operator is used as a pattern and pattern matching is performed

# Get input from the user

stdin = standard input
stdout = standard output
stderr = standard error

By default, stdin comes from keyboard, stdout/stderr go to the screen
stdin can come from other sources

`sudo su - myusername`

`su` switch user, starts a login shell

`ps -ef` show every process

# alternate syntax for chmod

`chmod +x my-script.sh`

# Random data, text and string manipulation

I can use `!e` to invoke the last command that I invoked that began with `e`

`shasum`

I can list all files that have the word `sum` in them by doing the following:
`ls -l /usr/bin/*sum`

By putting the \* wildcard in the filename

Most commands that accept a file as an input can also accept piped data from another command

If a command is not a shell builtin, then I can use `man <command>`

`fold` folds a string into new liunes

SCRIPT ONE

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script creates a user on the local system
# You will be prompted to enter the username (login), the person name, and a password
# The usernamem, password, and host for the account will be displayed

if [[ "${UID}" -ne 0 ]]
then
  echo 'Please run with sudo or as root.'
  exit 1
fi

# -p is for prompt
read -p 'Enter the username to create: ' USER_NAME
read -p 'Enter the person name: ' COMMENT
read -p 'Enter the password to use for the account: ' PASSWORD

useradd -c "${COMMENT}" -m ${USER_NAME}

if [[ "${?}" -ne 0 ]]
then
  echo 'The account could not be created.'
  exit 1
fi

# Set the password by piping it into the passwd command
echo ${PASSWORD} | passwd --stdin ${USER_NAME}

if [[ "${?}" -ne 0 ]]
then
  echo 'The password could not be set.'
  exit 1
fi

# Expire the password
passwd -e ${USER_NAME}

# Display username, password, and the host

# Add a blank line, echo by itself with no arg will create a newline
echo

echo 'username:'
echo "${USER_NAME}"
echo
echo 'password:'
echo "${PASSWORD}"
echo
echo 'host:'
# HOSTNAME is a shell variable
echo "${HOSTNAME}"

# Successful exit
exit 0
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment
# This script displays various information to the screen
# Display the text hello
echo 'Hello'

# Assign a value to a variable
WORD='script'

# Display the value of the variable
echo "$WORD"

# When referencing a value, must use $
# Single quotes prevent the expansion of variables
# Double quotes allow interpolation
echo "This is a $WORD"

# Alternate syntax
echo "This is a ${WORD}"

# Append text to the variable, must ${} syntax
echo "${WORD}ing"

# Variables are declared in all uppercase by convention
ENDING='ed'

echo "This is ${WORD}${ENDING}."

# Reassign a variable
ENDING='ing'


```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Display the UID and username of the user executing the script
# Display if the user is the root user or not

# Display the UID
echo "Your UID is ${UID}"

# Display the username
echo "Your username is ${USER}"

# Display if the user is the root user or not

# Store the resolved value of a command to a variable
USER_NAME=$(id -un)

# Alternate syntax of above, older style
USER_NAME_ALT=`id -un`

echo "Your username is ${USER_NAME}"

# Always enclose variables in if statements in quotation marks
# The double bracket syntax is bash specific
# Single brackets is an older syntax
if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0 ]]
then
  echo "You are the root user"
else
  echo "You are not the root user"
fi
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Display the UID and username of the user executing the script

# Display the UID (UID is Shell variable that is set by default)
echo "Your UID is ${UID}"

# Only display if the UID does NOT match 1000
UID_TO_TEST_FOR='1000'

if [[ "${UID}" -ne UID_TO_TEST_FOR ]]
then
  echo "UID does not match ${UID_TO_TEST_FOR}"
  exit 1
fi

# Display the username
USER_NAME=$(id -un)

# Test if the command succeeded
if [[ "${?}" -ne 0 ]]
then
  echo 'The id command did not execute successfully.'
  exit 1
fi

echo "Your username is ${USER_NAME}"

# You can use a string to test conditional

USER_NAME_TO_TEST_FOR='postmac'

if [[ "${USER_NAME}" = "${USER_NAME_TO_TEST_FOR}" ]]
then
  echo "Your username matches ${USER_NAME_TO_TEST_FOR}"
else
  echo "Your username does not match ${USER_NAME_TO_TEST_FOR}"
fi

# Test for inequality (!=) for the string

if [[ "${USER_NAME}" != "${USER_NAME_TO_TEST_FOR}" ]]
then
  echo "Your username does not match ${USER_NAME_TO_TEST_FOR}"
  exit 1
fi

exit 0




```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script creates and account on the local system.
# You will be prompted for the account name and password.

# Ask for the user name

read -p 'Enter the username to create: ' USER_NAME

# Ask for the real name
read -p 'Enter the name of the person who this account is for: ' COMMENT

# Ask for the password
read -p 'Enter the password to use for the account: ' PASSWORD

# Create the user
useradd -c "${COMMENT}" -m ${USER_NAME}
# COMMENT variable is in quotes because it may contain spaces, this allows it to expand
# in quotes, the arg gets treated as a single item even if it contains spaces

# Set the password for the user
echo ${USER_NAME} | passwd --stdin ${USER_NAME}

# When use a pipe, it means take the stdout from the preceding command
# and pass it as the stdin to the following command
# if the first command fails, it goes to stderr, which is not passed


# Force the user to change their password on first login

passwrd -e ${USER_NAME}
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script generates a list of random password

# Random number
PASSWORD="${RANDOM}"
echo "${PASSWORD}${PASSWORD}${PASSWORD}"

# Use current date and time

# epoch time
echo "$(date +%s)"
PASSWORD="$(date +%s)"
echo "${PASSWORD}"

# nano second
echo "$(date +%N)"

# both
echo "$(date +%s%N)"

# checksum and crytographic hash function

# pipe output of date command into shasum command

echo $(date +%s%N | shasum)

# How to control number of characters
# head is a program that prints the first n lines of a file or first c chars

PASSWORD=$(date +%s%N | shasum | head -c9)

# Better password
PASSWORD=$(date +%s%N${RANDOM}${RANDOM}) | shasum | head -c32)

# Randomly select a character from a string
SPECIAL_CHARS="!@#$%^&*()_+"

# shuf will shuffle a string

MY_SPECIAL_CHAR=$(echo '!@#$%^&*()_+' | fold -w1 | shuf | head -c1)

# shuf does not work in zsh?

echo "${PASSWORD}${MY_SPECIAL_CHAR}"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Display what the user typed on the command line

echo "You executed this command: ${0}"

# $0 is a positional parameter

# Parameter is a variable that is being used inside a shell script

# $0 is the first param, the script itself, aka the command, could contain the path to the script
# $1 is the first arg

echo "You called script with: ${1}"

# display the path and filename of the script



# basename is a command that lists the name of the file at the end of a path
# dirname is another command

echo "You used $(dirname ${0}) as the path to the $(basename ${0}) script"
```
