you dont have to sacrifice quality for velocity

high quality code is conducive to high output
important at any level

even highest level engineers still spoend 20% of their time writing code

code quality is by far the most misunderstood metric

- trademark sign of a bad software engineer is low quality

you can always throw more hours to increase quanitty, cannot do so for quality

apply 80/20 rule for quality

how to think about/optimize velocity

how to think about/optimize quality

VELOCITY

Go deep, not wide

- pick one tech stack and stick with it
- breaadth is cheap
- takes 2-4 years to become proficient at a stack
- avoid being full stack
- will eventually hit an inflection point wher eyou can code really fast
- dont switch stacks to maximize job opportunity

Be tactical with meetings
