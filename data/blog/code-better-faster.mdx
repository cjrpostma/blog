2 axes of good code machine

- quality
- velocity

code machine is a recognized term for staff engineer type. archetypes at meta
product manager archteype
code machine archetype

you dont have to sacrifice quality for velocity

high quality code is conducive to high output
important at any level

even highest level engineers still spoend 20% of their time writing code

---

code quality is by far the most misunderstood metric

- trademark sign of a bad software engineer is low quality

you can always throw more hours to increase quanitty, cannot do so for quality

apply 80/20 rule for quality

how to think about/optimize velocity

how to think about/optimize quality

VELOCITY

Go deep, not wide

- pick one tech stack and stick with it
- breaadth is cheap
- takes 2-4 years to become proficient at a stack
- avoid being full stack
- will eventually hit an inflection point wher eyou can code really fast
- dont switch stacks to maximize job opportunity

Be tactical with meetings

-common failure mode is to attend every meeting on your calendar

- juniors commonly do this
- skip meetings where you arent a major player
- always retrospect on meeting value
- establish focus blocks
  --long period of time that is uninterrupted where you can focus
  -- should be for coding
  -- coding is heavily momementum oriented
  --- context switching is really disruptive, takes a long time to get the context to code
  --- takes time to set up environment, context

an engineer with 1 x 8 hours will produce twice as much as code as an engineer with 4 x 2 hour blocks
try to have 1-2 days per week with no interruptions

Look for patterns

all tech stacks follow a power law

- some components matter far more than others

example: rendering a list of items on mobile

- should have an opinion on this
- e.g. there are three ways to do this, this way is better for this reason, etc. pros and cons

identify common components to master

once you have identified these patterns, which may be unique per team/org,
get really good at them, at those patterns

learn how to get really good at these common things/patterns

Do side projects

- "Life hack" to write more code without overworking
- Build things for fun on the side
- This builds skills
- if you want to get better at a skill, just need to spend more time practicing that skill

expecially ppowerfully if you work at a startup and work on frontend

- can almost copy/paste code from your personal side project into work work
  because youve already solved a lot of problems in your side projects

other benefits of side project

- fun
- builds more holistic product skills
- make you a more complete engineer
- will help spark creativity at work
- will help you learn more modern ways to do things because work proejcts might persist older patterns
- side projecvt allows you to explore modern approaches

Time spent after writing code

what is the breakdown of how time is spent

what happens once you write the code to getting it landed (eg committed to main)

noob engineer

- submit code for review
  -- add summary, test plan, screenshots, does some but not much here
- receive code review
- resolve comments, merge conflicts
- Land code into main

Pro engineer

- submit code for review - spends longer here, screenshots, videos, etc
  --- very ccarefully explains everything
- code review time is way faster due to step one being more complete
- land code -- takes less time, will land the code right away, this time should be as fast as possible
  want cycle to be super quick
  pro engineer explains very well what they are doing
  anticipates the questions that other people will have in the test plan summary
