SUMMARY OF BELOW

- Do the non-coding work to put team in a good position
- Ask your manager to treat you as a resource and offload their work

- In meetings, try re-stating what other people said
- Take notes to share with others

Earn trust quickly: Be "aggressively" nice. Find out how you can add value to others and be very sincere and upfront about it.

Fill in the gaps: View your projects holistically and figure out what's missing to move the project forward.
This will often times be "less flashy" non-coding work.

Bring people together: Don't be paralyzed by your lack of knowledge. Especially if you're new to a company,
you will be clueless in a lot of scenarios. If you're in a cutting edge company like Meta/Robinhood, there will
be a smart person(s) somewhere out there with the answer: You just need to bring them together in a healthy way.

Go deep: There's far more to a senior engineer than their ability to code. If you're a new L5+ engineer,
even the tenured L3/L4s at the company will code circles around you in the beginning.
If you're an L5+ engineer, figure out what behaviors and fundamentals you have that more junior
engineers don't and show those as much as you can.
This generally involves shipping software in a much more holistic way.

After starting, Alex told his managers that he was happy to offload any responsibilities they had so they
could focus on higher-level issues and expand their scope.
As a tech lead, you need to view your manager as a partner, not just a boss. "Treat me as a resource."

The project that Alex was first put on was to make settings more server-driven within Robinhood

The most impactful thing to do was to add color to the project:

Stabilize and then drive the workstream meetings

Create a thorough tech spec

Align XFN to figure out how to treat each settings section properly, especially in places where there were inconsistencies
