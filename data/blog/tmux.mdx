I'm working to transition to VIM for my daily development work and tmux is a natural partner for a terminal based editor.

I recently followed a [video](https://youtu.be/U-omALWIBos) by Josean Martinez where he describes his tmux setup from
dotfiles all the way to keyboard shortcuts and have decided to use this as my starting point.
You can view my dotfiles on GitHub [here](https://github.com/cjrpostma/dotfiles_macos).

If attempting to use the below bindings, be sure to follow the linked tutorial above, as some bindings require plugins
and others require bindings specified in `tmux.conf`.

- Why use versus integrated iTerm2 version?
  dotfiles
  mention plugins that allow vi movements
