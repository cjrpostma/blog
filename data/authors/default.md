This blog is my space to practice learning in public (see this great post on
[learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) by swyx). My goal is to translate daily learnings into this
blog as a learning diary. In doing so, I seek to reinforce my own understanding of topics and develop an easy language
to share my learnings with colleagues.
