I'm finally fully committing to learning VIM. It's been a learning goal for the past year that
I keep avoiding as other topics have taken priority. Recently, however, a close friend started
teaching himself VIM and the excitement caught on. I could no longer resist.

I think it's also beneficial to learn as soon as possible because once you commit the basics
to memory, you can continue to train it passively as you work. It's a skill that grows with you
everyday while you work. Therefore, I plan to get myself to the same speed as my previous
configuration with VIM as soon as possible so that I can begin training it passively while I
take on new topics.

VIM stands for Vi IMproved, a vi-derivative text editor based on the original Vi editor that was released in 1976.
VIM was written by Bram Moolenaar and released in 1991. VIM comes with Linux, BSD, and macOS. It's a small and fast
program that can be run in a terminal.

Some of the main benefits of VIM are as follows:

1. It is omnipresent -- available on most machines and bindings exist for most editors
2. It has a low memory footprint and is fast
3. Highly configurable via simple text files
4. It uses commands that can be composed together to accomplish complex text-based tasks

VIM is also a modal editor as opposed to a modeless editor. Modal editors offer multiple types of interaction modes
which are each optimized for specific tasks. The original intent of modal editors was to allow users to perform
complex operations without the use of a mouse, which may not have been available at the time. This is still a primary
benefit today, the ability to quickly move through and edit files without a mouse.

A few of the modes available are as follows:

- Normal mode - movement (default)
- Insert mode - editing
- Visual mode - selecting
- Visual line mode - selecting multiple lines
- Command mode - do things like write buffer, quit, etc.
- Replace mode - replace text at position

As part of my learning, I am following [this](https://youtu.be/H3o4l4GVLW0) video series by The Primeagen wherein he provides chunks of commands to get
started so as to not be overwhelmed. Below are some notes from each video that I am taking to aid my learning.
