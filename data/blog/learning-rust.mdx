I've had the desire to learn a new language lately. I originally was going to teach myself Go however I think Rust is
the better choice for exploring new paradigms and helping me to think differently.

Usually when starting something new, my approach is to begin with some guided learning before mixing in self-directed
learning and exploration. To that end, I will be completing two courses that I recently purchased on Udemy. The
following are my notes from these courses.

## Origin

- Rust is a systems programming language that is pursuing safety, concurrency, and speed.
- Ruby and Python will get you safety.
- C/C++ will get you concurrency and speed but not safety.

Rust was started in 2006 by a Mozilla employee named Graydon Hoare. It was officially sponsored by Mozilla in 2009.
Version 1 was released in 2015. Mozilla sponsored the language because they wanted something besides C++ to write
FireFox in.

## Cargo

Cargo is Rust's package manager. It is also the build system and test runner and documentation generator. It's like
NPM, PIP, make, etc.

`cargo new hello` will create a new project.

- Config files in Rust use the .toml extension, which stands for Tom's Obvious Minimal Language.
- Rust files use the .rs extension.
- `cargo.toml` is the config file for your project.
